# Everything in Eclipse

Everything is in Eclipse. As a Java Devloper, I consider Eclipse as my fisrt IDE.  Eclipse is more powerful than you think. So I collected the commonly used Eclipse plugins here.

## Eclipse

### Eclipse SDK 

Eclipse SDK will be a good start. Laster version of Eclipse : https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

## Code Style 

### Checkstyle

Checkstyle is a Open Source development tool to help you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding standards. Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java source code and pointing out items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules.
